This is for use in a very specific location and is not a general program for renaming PDFS.

Scans files for a  code starting with C or E followed by 9 digits, ex E241000301, where the first two digits are
 the sample year, the next two are the month and the last five digits are the sample number. This will likely not
 work when the samples are over 999.  Renames the files in place, to that code.
